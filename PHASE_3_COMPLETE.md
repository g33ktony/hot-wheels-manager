## 🚀 Next Steps - Immediate Actions Required

### Step 1: Manual Dashboard Configuration (5 minutes)

**Vercel Dashboard Setup:**

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select project: `hot-wheels-manager`
3. Click: **Settings → Environment Variables**
4. Add these environment variables:

| Variable | Value | Environment |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| `VITE_API_URL` | `https://hot-wheels-manager-staging.up.railway.app/api` | Preview |
| `VITE_API_URL` | `https://hot-wheels-manager-production.up.railway.app/api` | Production |

**Steps:**
- Click "+ Add New"
- Name: `VITE_API_URL`
- Value (Preview): `https://hot-wheels-manager-staging.up.railway.app/api`
- Check: ☑️ Preview
- Click: Add
- Repeat for Production

### Step 2: Railway Backend Configuration (5 minutes)

**Railway Dashboard Setup:**

1. Go to: https://railway.app/dashboard
2. Select project: `hot-wheels-manager` (staging)
3. Select service: `backend`
4. Click: **Variables**
5. Verify/Update these:

```env
# Existing (verify correct):
NODE_ENV=production
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://...
JWT_SECRET=...

# Critical for auth to work:
CORS_ORIGIN=https://hot-wheels-manager-git-featur-*.vercel.app,https://hot-wheels-manager-staging.up.railway.app
BACKEND_URL=https://hot-wheels-manager-staging.up.railway.app
```

**For Production:**
```env
CORS_ORIGIN=https://hot-wheels-manager.vercel.app,https://hot-wheels-manager-production.up.railway.app
BACKEND_URL=https://hot-wheels-manager-production.up.railway.app
```

### Step 3: Deploy and Test (10 minutes)

**Trigger Vercel Redeploy:**
```bash
# Push code to feature branch (auto-triggers deployment)
git push origin feature/presale-system

# Or manually redeploy in Vercel:
# Dashboard → Deployments → Latest → Redeploy
```

**Test Login:**
1. Visit staging URL (check Vercel deployments)
2. Try login with: `admin@hotwheels.com` / password
3. Should see:
   - ✅ No 404 errors
   - ✅ Login succeeds
   - ✅ Redirects to dashboard
   - ✅ Token in localStorage

**Test Pre-Sale Form:**
1. Click "Pre-Ventas" in sidebar
2. Form should load
3. Try creating a pre-sale item:
   - Select supplier
   - Search for a car
   - Enter quantity and price
   - Submit
4. Should appear in recent list

## 📋 Deployment Verification Checklist

After configuration, use this checklist:

- [ ] **Backend Health Check**
  ```bash
  curl https://hot-wheels-manager-staging.up.railway.app/health
  # Should return 200 with status object
  ```

- [ ] **CORS Headers**
  ```bash
  curl -i https://hot-wheels-manager-staging.up.railway.app/health \
    -H "Origin: https://hot-wheels-manager-git-featur-xxxxx.vercel.app"
  # Should see: Access-Control-Allow-Origin header
  ```

- [ ] **Environment Variables Set**
  - Browser console: `console.log(import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL)`
  - Should show staging API URL with `/api`

- [ ] **Login Works**
  - No 404 errors
  - Token stored in localStorage
  - Dashboard loads

- [ ] **Pre-Sale Form Works**
  - Form displays on `/presale/purchase`
  - Can submit data
  - Shows success message

## 🎯 Phase 4: Pre-Sale Dashboard (3-4 days)

After Phase 3 is verified working, next phase:

### Components to Build
1. **PreSaleDashboard.tsx** - Main dashboard page
2. **PreSaleItemCard.tsx** - Individual item display
3. **PreSaleFilters.tsx** - Filter by status/car/supplier
4. **PreSaleAnalytics.tsx** - Profit and quantity tracking
5. **PreSaleStats.tsx** - Summary statistics

### Features
- Real-time list of active pre-sales
- Filter by status (pending, in-progress, completed)
- Filter by car model
- Filter by supplier
- Sort by date, profit, quantity
- Unit tracking with visual indicators
- Profit analytics and trending
- Quick actions (edit, cancel, assign units)

### Integration
- Use `usePreSaleItems` hook for data
- Use `usePreSaleActiveSummary` for stats
- Real-time updates with React Query

## 💡 Tips for Success

### Before Phase 4 Starts
1. ✅ Verify deployment works on staging
2. ✅ Test all authentication flows
3. ✅ Ensure pre-sale form submits successfully
4. ✅ Check console for any warnings/errors

### Development Best Practices (Phase 4+)
1. **Build incrementally** - Add one component at a time
2. **Test as you go** - Use React Query DevTools to check caching
3. **Follow patterns** - Use same structure as Purchases/Sales components
4. **Reuse components** - Card, Modal, Input, Button from component library
5. **TypeScript first** - Define interfaces before components

### Git Workflow
```bash
# Phase 3 is on feature/presale-system branch
# For Phase 4, continue on same branch

# After each feature:
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add [feature-name] to dashboard"
git push origin feature/presale-system

# After all phases complete:
git checkout main
git merge feature/presale-system
git push origin main
```

   - Must include `/api` suffix

3. **CORS Issues:**
   - If login fails, check CORS in Railway Dashboard
   - Verify Vercel URL matches `CORS_ORIGIN`
   - Check browser DevTools for CORS errors
