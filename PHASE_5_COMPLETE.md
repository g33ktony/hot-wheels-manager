}
```

**Usage Example:**

- Auto-refetch on stale

### 2. **usePaymentPlanById(id: string)**
- Fetches single payment plan by ID
- Enabled only when ID provided
- Stale time: 2 minutes
- Cache time: 5 minutes

### 3. **usePaymentSchedule(paymentPlanId: string)**
- Fetches payment schedule for a plan
- Returns array of schedule items
- Enabled only when plan ID provided
- Stale time: 5 minutes

### 4. **usePaymentAnalytics(paymentPlanId: string)**
- Fetches analytics data for a plan
- Metrics: on-time %, overdue rate, averages
- Enabled only when plan ID provided

### 5. **useRecordPayment()**
- Mutation hook for recording payments
