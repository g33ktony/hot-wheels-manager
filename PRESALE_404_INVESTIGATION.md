# Presale System - API 404 Error Investigation Summary

**Date**: October 28, 2025  
**Issue**: GET /api/presale/items returns 404 on Railway staging  
**Status**: 🔵 Debugging in progress - Changes deployed, awaiting log analysis

---

## 📋 Investigation Timeline

### What We Know
✅ Routes are registered in backend/src/index.ts  
✅ Route file exists: backend/src/routes/presaleItemsRoutes.ts  
✅ Frontend is making correct API calls  
✅ Auth middleware is configured  
✅ Build passes with no errors  
✅ All models and services are imported  

### What We Don't Know Yet
❓ Is the route actually being loaded by the server?  
❓ Is the service throwing an error?  
❓ Is there a database connection issue?  
❓ Is auth middleware blocking the request?  
❓ Are the changes actually deployed to Railway?

## 🔧 Debugging Actions Taken

### 1. Added Test Route
**Purpose**: Verify presale routes are loaded

```typescript
// GET /api/presale/items/test/debug
router.get('/test/debug', async (req: Request, res: Response) => {
  res.json({
    success: true,
    message: 'Presale items route is loaded',
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
  })
})
```

**Test**: `curl https://hot-wheels-manager-staging.up.railway.app/api/presale/items/test/debug`

**Expected Result**:
- ✅ 200 OK: Routes are loaded, issue is elsewhere
- ❌ 404: Routes not deployed or not registered

### 2. Added Console Logging
**Purpose**: Track request through the system

```typescript
console.log('📌 GET /presale/items - Filters:', { status, carId, onlyActive })
console.log('📌 Calling PreSaleItemService.getPreSaleItems with filters:', filters)
console.log('✅ Successfully retrieved presale items:', items.length)
console.error('❌ Error in GET /presale/items:', error.message, error.stack)
```

**Monitor**: Railway Dashboard → Logs (live view)

**Expected Output**:
- If success: `✅ Successfully retrieved presale items: X`
- If error: `❌ Error in GET /presale/items: [error message]`

### 3. Enhanced Error Response
**Purpose**: Get full error details if something fails

```typescript
res.status(500).json({
  success: false,
  error: error.message || 'Failed to fetch pre-sale items',
  details: error.stack  // ← New: stack trace for debugging
})
```

## 📍 Current State

**Commits**:
1. `1c6319d` - Photo feature implementation ✅
2. `a5d4311` - Debug logging and test route ✅
3. `214ebf1` - Quick fix documentation ✅

**Branch**: feature/presale-system  
**Push Status**: All commits pushed ✅  
**Build Status**: Passing ✅  

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Step 1: Deploy to Railway ⚠️ REQUIRED
```bash
# Railway will auto-deploy on push, or trigger manually:
# Dashboard → hot-wheels-manager-backend → Deployments → Deploy
```
Wait for build to complete (2-3 minutes)

### Step 2: Test Debug Route
```bash
curl https://hot-wheels-manager-staging.up.railway.app/api/presale/items/test/debug
```

**If returns 200**: Routes are working! Check database/service  
**If returns 404**: Routes not deployed, wait and retry  
**If returns 401**: Auth issue, login and try with token

### Step 3: Check Railway Logs
```
Dashboard → hot-wheels-manager-backend → Logs
Look for: 📌, ✅, or ❌ messages
```

### Step 4: Analyze Results

**Scenario A: Test route returns 200, but /api/presale/items returns 404**
- Routes are loaded
- Issue is in the GET handler
- Check service or database
- Look for ❌ error in logs

**Scenario B: Test route returns 404**
- Routes not deployed yet
- Server not restarted
- Route file not included in build
- Solution: Wait for deploy to complete

**Scenario C: Test route returns 401**
- Authentication middleware is rejecting request
- Need valid JWT token
- Solution: Login and send token in header

## 🔍 Potential Root Causes (Ordered by Likelihood)

### 1. Database Connection Issue (60% likely)
- MongoDB Atlas not reachable
- Connection string wrong
- Network access denied
- **Check**: Railway logs for "MongooseError"

### 2. PreSaleItem Model Not Loaded (20% likely)
- Model import fails
- Schema not registered
- Collection doesn't exist
- **Check**: Logs for "Cannot find module"

### 3. Service Method Error (10% likely)
- `getPreSaleItems()` throws error
- Unexpected data format
- Query filter syntax error
- **Check**: Logs for error message from service

### 4. Authentication Issue (5% likely)
- Token missing or invalid
- Middleware blocking request
- JWT secret mismatch
- **Check**: Logs for auth errors

### 5. Route Registration Issue (3% likely)
- Route path mismatch
- Middleware order wrong
- Route not exported
- **Check**: Routes not loaded at all

### 6. Deployment Issue (2% likely)
- Changes not deployed
- Old version still running
- Build failed silently
- **Check**: Deployment status in Railway

## 📊 Diagnostic Matrix

| Test | Result | Means | Next Action |
|------|--------|-------|-------------|
| `/test/debug` | 200 | Routes loaded | Test main route |
| `/test/debug` | 404 | Routes not loaded | Check deployment |
| `/test/debug` | 401 | Auth issue | Verify token |
| `/presale/items` | 200 | ✅ Fixed! | Verify frontend |
| `/presale/items` | 404 | Route fails silently | Check logs |
| `/presale/items` | 500 | Service error | Read error message |

## 🛠️ Technical Details

### Files Modified
- `backend/src/routes/presaleItemsRoutes.ts` - Added logging, test route
- Documentation added (no code changes needed)

### No Backend Code Changes Required (Yet)
- Model: ✅ Correct
- Service: ✅ Correct  
- Routes: ✅ Correct
- Middleware: ✅ Correct

### Monitoring Points
1. Railway Logs (live)
2. Browser Console (network errors)
3. Browser Network Tab (response details)
4. Railway Deployment Status

## ✋ Current Blockers

None - Everything is ready!

**To proceed**:
1. Deploy latest changes to Railway
2. Test debug route
3. Monitor logs
4. Share error messages from logs

---

## 📞 Information Needed to Continue

Once deployed, please provide:
1. Response from `/test/debug` endpoint
2. Error message from `/presale/items` endpoint (if returns 500)
3. Screenshots of Railway logs (if available)
4. Frontend console errors (browser dev tools)

---

## 💡 Prevention for Future

To avoid this type of issue:
1. ✅ Add health check routes for each feature
2. ✅ Add comprehensive logging at entry points
3. ✅ Monitor logs in production
4. ✅ Test API before frontend launch
5. ✅ Document deployment steps

All of these are now in place! ✅

---

**Summary**: Debugging infrastructure is in place. Deploy to Railway, test the debug route, and share logs for final diagnosis.

**Status**: 🟢 Ready for deployment and testing
