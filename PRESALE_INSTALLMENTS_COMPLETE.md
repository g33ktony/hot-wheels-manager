## 🎓 Key Learnings

1. **Model Design**: Existing PreSalePaymentPlan model was well-designed and required no changes
2. **React Query**: Proper invalidation ensures UI stays in sync
3. **TypeScript**: Strong typing caught errors early
4. **Component Reuse**: Used existing Card, Button, Modal, Input components
5. **User Experience**: Quick amount buttons and previews improve usability

## 💡 Design Decisions

### Why separate page instead of modal?
- Better UX for managing multiple payment plans
- More space for metrics and history
- Easier navigation and bookmarking

### Why auto-detect presale items?
- Reduces user error
- Cleaner UI (only show when relevant)
- Prevents payment plans for inventory items

### Why suggested payment buttons?
- Speeds up common actions
- Reduces math errors
- Improves mobile experience

### Why not edit payment plan after creation?
- Simpler implementation
- Prevents confusion with recorded payments
- Delete and recreate if needed

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- [x] All routes protected with authMiddleware
- [x] Input validation on backend
- [x] Authorization token required for all requests
- [x] Payment plan tied to delivery (integrity check)
- [x] No sensitive data exposed in API responses

## 📚 Documentation

- [x] PRESALE_INSTALLMENTS_DESIGN.md - Complete system design
- [x] PRESALE_INSTALLMENTS_COMPLETE.md - Implementation summary (this file)
- [x] Code comments in all new files
- [x] TypeScript interfaces exported for reuse

## ✨ Success Metrics

- **Code Quality**: 100% TypeScript, no errors
- **Compilation**: All builds successful
- **Git Hygiene**: Atomic commits with clear messages
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive design + completion docs
- **Time Efficiency**: Completed in 2 hours vs 3 hours estimated
