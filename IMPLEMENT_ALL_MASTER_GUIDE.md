## What You're About to Do

You are implementing **ALL remaining configuration** to get your staging deployment working end-to-end.

### Current State:
‚úÖ All code is written and compiles (2,719 modules)  
‚úÖ All backend API endpoints exist  
‚úÖ All frontend components created  
‚úÖ All routing and navigation configured  
‚ùå Environment variables NOT set in Vercel  
‚ùå CORS NOT configured in Railway  
‚ùå Staging deployment NOT tested  

### What Will Be Fixed:
1. ‚úÖ Vercel environment variables set
2. ‚úÖ Railway CORS configured
3. ‚úÖ Both services redeployed
4. ‚úÖ All three phases tested
5. ‚úÖ System ready for Phase 6

## Your 5-Step Action Plan

### STEP 1: Configure Vercel (10 minutes)

**Document:** `VERCEL_CONFIGURATION_STEPS.md`

**Quick Summary:**
- Go to Vercel Dashboard
- Select "hot-wheels-manager" project
- Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
- Add/Update `VITE_API_URL`:
  - Preview: `https://hot-wheels-manager-staging.up.railway.app/api`
  - Production: `https://hot-wheels-manager-production.up.railway.app/api`
- Redeploy frontend

**When Complete:** Frontend will have access to backend API

---

### STEP 2: Configure Railway Backend (10 minutes)

**Document:** `RAILWAY_BACKEND_CONFIGURATION.md`

**Quick Summary:**
- Go to Railway Dashboard
- Select "hot-wheels-manager-backend" project
- Go to Variables tab
- Add/Update `CORS_ORIGIN`:
  ```
  https://hot-wheels-manager-staging.vercel.app,https://hot-wheels-manager.vercel.app,https://hot-wheels-manager-production.vercel.app,http://localhost:3000,http://localhost:5173
  ```
- Redeploy backend

**When Complete:** Backend will accept requests from Vercel frontend

---

### STEP 3: Wait for Redeployments (5-10 minutes)

**What's Happening:**
- Vercel rebuilds frontend with new env vars
- Railway rebuilds backend with new CORS config
- Both services restart with new configurations

**How to Know It's Done:**
- Vercel Dashboard shows "Ready" status (green)
- Railway Dashboard shows "Live" status (green)
- Both completed within last 5 minutes

---

### STEP 4: Run Full Test Suite (10 minutes)

**Document:** `TESTING_ALL_PHASES.md`

**Test 1: Phase 3 Form**
- Go to https://hot-wheels-manager.vercel.app/presale/purchase
- Submit a pre-sales form
- ‚úÖ Should succeed without errors

**Test 2: Phase 4 Dashboard** (THIS IS THE CRITICAL ONE - IT WAS BROKEN)
- Go to https://hot-wheels-manager.vercel.app/presale/dashboard
- ‚úÖ Should load items WITHOUT 404 error
- ‚úÖ This proves the fix worked!

**Test 3: Phase 5 Payments**
- Go to https://hot-wheels-manager.vercel.app/presale/payments
- ‚úÖ Should load payment data without errors

**Test 4: Full Workflow**
- Create ‚Üí Dashboard ‚Üí Payments
- ‚úÖ Data should be consistent across all pages

---

### STEP 5: Document Results (5 minutes)

**When All Tests Pass:**
- Create a file: `STAGING_DEPLOYMENT_SUCCESSFUL.md`
- Document what you tested
- Document any issues you found
- Note any needed fixes

**If Tests Fail:**
- Consult: `DEBUGGING_404_ERROR.md` or `QUICK_FIX_404.md`
- Check browser console for exact errors
- Verify both Vercel and Railway show "Ready"/"Live"
- Wait 5 minutes and try again

---

## Key URLs You'll Need

**Vercel Dashboard:**  
https://vercel.com/dashboard

**Railway Dashboard:**  
https://railway.app/dashboard

**Your Staging URLs:**  
- Frontend: https://hot-wheels-manager.vercel.app
- Backend: https://hot-wheels-manager-production.up.railway.app/api

**Local Dev (for reference):**  
- Frontend: http://localhost:5173
- Backend: http://localhost:3001/api
