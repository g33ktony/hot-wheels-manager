## 🎓 Key Learnings

1. **Component Reusability**: Smaller focused components (PaymentStats, OverduePaymentsAlert) are more reusable

2. **Caching Strategy**: Different stale times for different data types improves both freshness and performance

3. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive loading/error states at component level ensures better UX

4. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage prevents runtime errors and aids development

5. **API Integration**: Proper hook abstractions make API calls more maintainable
