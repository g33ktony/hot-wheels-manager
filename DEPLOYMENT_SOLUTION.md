# 🎯 Railway Deployment - FINAL SOLUTION

## ✅ What Was Fixed

**Problem**: Railway couldn't find `@shared/types` module because it was building from the `backend/` directory only.

**Root Cause**: Railway was treating `backend` as an isolated project, unable to access `../shared/` folder.

**Solution**: Converted project to **npm workspaces** monorepo structure.

---

## 📦 Changes Made

### 1. **Root `package.json`** - Added Workspaces
```json
{
  "workspaces": ["backend", "frontend", "shared"]
}
```

### 2. **`shared/package.json`** - Created Workspace Package
```json
{
  "name": "@shared/types",
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

### 3. **`railway.toml`** - Updated Build Command
```toml
[build]
buildCommand = "npm install && cd backend && npm run build"
```

### 4. **Backend `tsconfig.json`** - Already Had Correct Paths
```json
{
  "paths": {
    "@shared/*": ["../shared/*"]
  }
}
```

---

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Root `npm install`**: Sets up workspace symlinks
   - Creates `node_modules/@shared/types` → symlink to `./shared`
   
2. **Backend Build**: TypeScript can now resolve `@shared/types`
   - Path mapping: `@shared/*` → `../shared/*`
   - Node resolution finds it in parent `node_modules/@shared/types`

3. **Runtime**: Backend can import shared types
   ```typescript
   import { HotWheelsCar } from '@shared/types';
   ```

## ⚙️ Railway Configuration Required

### ❗ CRITICAL: Set Root Directory

In Railway Dashboard → Your Service → Settings:

**Root Directory**: Must be `/` or empty (NOT `backend`)

If this is set to `backend`, Railway can't run `npm install` from root and workspaces won't be set up.

### Environment Variables

Add in Railway Dashboard:
- `MONGODB_URI` - MongoDB Atlas connection string
- `NODE_ENV` - `production`
- `CORS_ORIGIN` - Your Vercel frontend URL
- `PORT` - Auto-injected by Railway (usually 3000)

## ✅ Verification

### Local Build Test (Passed ✓)
```bash
npm install                    # ✓ Workspaces set up
cd backend && npm run build    # ✓ TypeScript compiles
npm ls @shared/types           # ✓ Shows: @shared/types@1.0.0 -> ./shared
```

### What Railway Will Do
```bash
# 1. Clone repository
# 2. Run: npm install (from root)
#    └─ Sets up: node_modules/@shared/types -> ./shared
# 3. Run: cd backend && npm run build
#    └─ TypeScript finds @shared/types via path mapping
# 4. Run: cd backend && npm start
#    └─ Server starts with access to compiled code
```

## 📝 Next Steps

1. **Commit Changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Configure npm workspaces for Railway deployment"
   git push
   ```

2. **Configure Railway**:
   - Set Root Directory to `/`
   - Add environment variables
   - Deploy!

3. **Check Build Logs**:
   - Should see `npm install` from root first
   - Then `cd backend && npm run build`
   - No errors about missing `@shared/types`

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Still Getting `Cannot find module '@shared/types'`?

**Check Railway's Root Directory setting**:
- Go to Service → Settings → Root Directory
- It MUST be `/` or empty
- If it says `backend`, change it to `/`
- Redeploy

### Build Logs Don't Show `npm install`?

Railway might be caching. Try:
1. Delete the service in Railway
2. Create a new service from the repo
3. Set Root Directory to `/` BEFORE first deploy
4. Add environment variables
5. Deploy
