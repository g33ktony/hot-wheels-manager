## Troubleshooting: If Something Goes Wrong

### Issue: Still See 404 Error

**Try These:**
1. Hard refresh browser: `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows)
2. Wait 5 minutes and reload
3. Clear browser cache
4. Try in Incognito/Private window

**If Still Broken:**
1. Check Vercel Settings - is VITE_API_URL really set?
2. Check Railway Variables - is CORS_ORIGIN really set?
3. Verify both show "Ready"/"Live" status
4. Wait another 5 minutes (caching)
5. See: `QUICK_FIX_404.md` for advanced troubleshooting

### Issue: CORS Error in Console

**Try These:**
1. Make sure CORS_ORIGIN in Railway includes your Vercel domain
2. Value should be: `https://hot-wheels-manager.vercel.app,...`
3. Redeploy Railway backend
4. Wait 5 minutes
5. Hard refresh browser

### Issue: Vercel Redeploy Fails

1. Check that env vars are saved (not just typed)
2. Try refreshing Vercel page
3. Try redeploying again
4. Check Vercel build logs for errors

### Issue: Railway Redeploy Fails

1. Check that env vars are saved
2. Try refreshing Railway page
3. Check Railway deployment logs for errors
4. Make sure backend port 3001 is available
