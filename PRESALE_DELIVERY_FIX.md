# Presale Items in Deliveries - Fix Complete ✅

## Problem
Error when creating deliveries with presale items:
```
"Error al crear la entrega. Los items seleccionados pueden ya no estar disponibles."
```

The presale item was successfully added to the delivery form, but the creation failed when clicking "Crear Entrega".

## Root Cause
The backend validation logic in `/deliveriesController.ts` was treating presale items like regular inventory items:
- Presale items have `inventoryItemId: "presale_{preSaleId}"` format
- Backend tried to find these IDs in the `InventoryItemModel` collection
- Since "presale_xxx" IDs don't exist in inventory, validation failed
- Error message: "Pieza no encontrada: presale_xxx"

## Solution

### Backend Changes (`/backend/src/controllers/deliveriesController.ts`)

1. **In `createDelivery` validation:**
   - Skip validation for items with `inventoryItemId` starting with `"presale_"`
   - Only validate real inventory items against the database
   - Only reserve quantity for real inventory items (not presale)

```typescript
// Skip presale items - they are pre-validated on frontend
if (item.inventoryItemId?.startsWith('presale_')) {
    itemExists = true; // Skip validation
} else if (item.inventoryItemId) {
    // Only validate real inventory items
    const inventoryItem = await InventoryItemModel.findById(item.inventoryItemId);
    // ... rest of validation
}
```

2. **In `createSalesFromDelivery` helper:**
   - Skip presale items when creating sales records
   - Only process real inventory items for sale creation
   - Presale items are managed separately by `PreSalePaymentPlan`

```typescript
// Skip presale items - they are handled by PreSalePaymentPlan
if (item.inventoryItemId?.startsWith('presale_')) {
    continue; // Don't create sale items for presale items
}
```

3. **In `removeSalesFromDelivery` helper:**
   - Only restore inventory for real inventory items
   - Don't try to restore presale items

### Frontend Implementation
Already correctly implemented:

✅ Presale items marked with `inventoryItemId: "presale_{id}"` prefix
✅ Presale items have `isSoldAsSeries: true` flag
✅ Frontend validation filters out presale items from inventory checks
✅ Quantity and price fields disabled for presale items
✅ Purple styling differentiates presale items from regular inventory
✅ Error dialog prevented before submission

## Data Flow

### Adding Presale Item to Delivery

```
User selects presale item from autocomplete
    ↓
Frontend creates delivery item:
{
    inventoryItemId: "presale_507f1f77bcf86cd799439011",  // Marked prefix
    carId: "RLC Exclusive Ford GT40 mkii",
    quantity: 1,
    unitPrice: 1350.00,
    isSoldAsSeries: true  // Presale flag
}
    ↓
User clicks "Crear Entrega"
    ↓
Frontend validates:
- Skip presale items in inventory validation ✓
- Allow presale items through ✓
    ↓
Backend receives request:
- Checks for "presale_" prefix ✓
- Skips inventory lookup ✓
- Saves delivery with presale item ✓
    ↓
Delivery created successfully! ✅
```

### Completing Delivery with Presale Items

```
Delivery marked as completed
    ↓
createSalesFromDelivery called:
- Presale items skipped (they go to PreSalePaymentPlan)
- Only real inventory items create sales records
- Presale status managed separately
    ↓
Sales created only for non-presale items ✓
Presale items tracked via PreSalePaymentPlan ✓
```

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Verify delivery is created successfully
- [ ] Verify presale item appears in delivery
- [ ] Test updating delivery with presale items
