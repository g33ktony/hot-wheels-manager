# Deployment: Status Filtering Feature

**Date**: October 12, 2025  
**Branch**: `release/delivery-report`  
**Commits**: 
- `56a55fc` - chore: Trigger deployment for status filtering feature
- `aa4742c` - feat: Add interactive status filtering to Deliveries page

## Deployment Status
✅ **PUSHED TO PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT**

### What's Being Deployed

#### Backend Changes
1. **Status Filtering Endpoint** (`/api/deliveries`)
   - Default excludes completed deliveries
   - Accepts `?status=<status>` query parameter
   - Performance optimized with lean queries and field projection

2. **Statistics Aggregation** (`/api/deliveries/stats`)
   - Returns delivery counts and totals grouped by status
   - MongoDB aggregation for efficiency
   - 5-second maxTimeMS protection

#### Frontend Changes
1. **Interactive Statistics Cards**
   - Clickable to filter deliveries
   - Visual feedback with colored rings
   - Hover states and transitions

2. **Filter Indicator Banner**
   - Shows active filter status
   - "Limpiar filtro" button to clear
   - Blue styling with proper spacing

3. **Smart Data Loading**
   - Status-aware caching with React Query
   - Statistics cached for 5 minutes
   - Proper query key separation

## Expected Results

### Performance Improvements
- **~80% reduction** in initial data load
- **5-10x faster** page load time
- **Single efficient query** for statistics

### User Experience
- By default, see only active deliveries (faster load)
- Click any statistic card to filter by status
- Clear visual feedback for active filters
- Easy to clear filters and return to default view

## Monitoring Points

After deployment, verify:
- [ ] Page loads significantly faster
- [ ] Statistics cards are clickable
- [ ] Filtering works correctly for each status
- [ ] Visual feedback (rings) appears on active filters
- [ ] Filter banner shows and clears properly
- [ ] Backend responds with correct filtered data
- [ ] No console errors in browser or backend logs

## Rollback Plan
If issues occur:
1. The feature is backward compatible
2. Default behavior (no filter) returns all active deliveries
3. Can revert commits: `git revert 56a55fc aa4742c`
4. Or merge previous commit: `git reset --hard 4393ff9`

## API Testing

Test the endpoints manually:

```bash
# Get active deliveries (default - excludes completed)
curl https://your-backend-url/api/deliveries

# Get only scheduled deliveries
curl https://your-backend-url/api/deliveries?status=scheduled

# Get statistics
curl https://your-backend-url/api/deliveries/stats
```

Expected statistics response:
```json
{
  "scheduled": { "count": 15, "totalAmount": 4500 },
  "prepared": { "count": 8, "totalAmount": 2400 },
  "completed": { "count": 120, "totalAmount": 36000 },
  "cancelled": { "count": 3, "totalAmount": 900 },
  "rescheduled": { "count": 2, "totalAmount": 600 }
}
```
