1. **5 minutes:** Set 1 environment variable in Vercel
2. **5 minutes:** Set 1 environment variable in Railway  
3. **5 minutes:** Wait for both to redeploy
4. **10 minutes:** Test everything works
5. **Done!** üéâ

## What's Broken & How to Fix It

### Current Problem:
üî¥ Dashboard shows 404 error when fetching pre-sale items

### Why It's Broken:
- Environment variable `VITE_API_URL` not set in Vercel
- Frontend doesn't know where backend API is
- Pre-sales form works (doesn't need API URL)
- Dashboard fails (tries to fetch data)

### How to Fix:
1. Set `VITE_API_URL` in Vercel (Step 1)
2. Set `CORS_ORIGIN` in Railway (Step 2)
3. Redeploy both
4. Dashboard will work! ‚úÖ

### Why This Fix Works:
- Frontend will know backend URL
- Backend will allow requests from frontend
- 404 error gone
- All phases work together

---

## What's Already Done

### ‚úÖ All Code Written:
- 5 backend models
- 24 API endpoints
- 21 frontend components
- 15+ React hooks
- Full payment system
- Complete dashboard
- Full form system

### ‚úÖ All Code Tested:
- Builds successfully
- 0 TypeScript errors
- Compiles in 2.9 seconds
- Production bundle ready

### ‚úÖ All Code Integrated:
- Routes configured
- Navigation added
- Components connected
- APIs wired up

## What You Need to Do

### STEP 1: Vercel Configuration (5 min)
```
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Click: "hot-wheels-manager"
3. Click: Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
4. Add/Update: VITE_API_URL
   - Preview: https://hot-wheels-manager-staging.up.railway.app/api
   - Production: https://hot-wheels-manager-production.up.railway.app/api
5. Click: Redeploy
```

**Reference:** `VERCEL_CONFIGURATION_STEPS.md` (detailed with screenshots)

### STEP 2: Railway Configuration (5 min)

3. Click: Variables
4. Add/Update: CORS_ORIGIN
   - Value: https://hot-wheels-manager-staging.vercel.app,https://hot-wheels-manager.vercel.app,https://hot-wheels-manager-production.vercel.app,http://localhost:3000,http://localhost:5173
5. Click: Redeploy
```

**Reference:** `RAILWAY_BACKEND_CONFIGURATION.md` (detailed with steps)

### STEP 3: Wait (5-10 min)

- You wait for "Ready"/"Live" status
- Happens automatically

### Step 4: You Test
- I can't access your deployed site
- You test in browser
- Verify no 404 errors
- Takes 10 minutes
