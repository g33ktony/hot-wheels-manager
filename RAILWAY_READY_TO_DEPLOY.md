# 🚀 Railway Deployment - READY TO DEPLOY

## ✅ Status: READY FOR DEPLOYMENT

All configuration files are now properly set up. The local build and startup work perfectly.

---

## 🎯 CRITICAL Railway Dashboard Settings

### 1. **Root Directory Setting**
**MUST BE SET TO:** `/` (root directory)

❗ **THIS IS CRITICAL** - If Railway is set to build from `backend/` directory, it will fail.

### 2. **Required Environment Variables**
Add these in Railway Dashboard → Your Service → Variables:

```
MONGODB_URI = mongodb+srv://your-mongodb-atlas-connection-string
NODE_ENV = production
PORT = (auto-injected by Railway, don't set manually)
CORS_ORIGIN = https://your-vercel-frontend-domain.vercel.app
```

### 3. **Build & Deploy Commands**
✅ **Already configured in `railway.toml`:**
- Build: `npm install` (from root)
- Start: `./start.sh` (comprehensive startup script)

---

## 📁 What Railway Will Do

1. **Clone repository** → Gets entire monorepo
2. **Run: `npm install`** → Sets up npm workspaces from root
3. **Run: `./start.sh`** → Executes our custom startup script:
   - Builds backend: `cd backend && npm run build`
   - Copies shared types to `backend/src/shared/`
   - Starts server: `cd backend && npm start`

---

## 🔧 Key Files Created/Modified

✅ **`railway.toml`** - Railway configuration
✅ **`start.sh`** - Comprehensive startup script with logging
✅ **`backend/package.json`** - Build script that copies shared types
✅ **`backend/tsconfig.json`** - TypeScript paths for `@shared/types`
✅ **Root `package.json`** - npm workspaces configuration

---

## ✅ Local Testing Results

```bash
✅ Build: npm run build - SUCCESS
✅ TypeScript: Resolves @shared/types - SUCCESS  
✅ Server Start: Binds to 0.0.0.0:3001 - SUCCESS
✅ MongoDB: Connects with timeout - SUCCESS
✅ Health Check: /health endpoint - SUCCESS
```

---

## 🚀 Deploy Steps

### 1. **Commit & Push**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Final Railway configuration with startup script"
git push
```

### 2. **Railway Dashboard Configuration**
1. Go to Railway Dashboard → Your Service → Settings
2. **Set Root Directory to `/`** (most important!)
3. Add environment variables (see above)
4. Deploy!

### 3. **Monitor Deployment**
Check Railway build logs for:
```
🚀 Starting Hot Wheels Manager Backend...
📁 Current directory: /app
🏗️  Building application...
🚀 Starting server...
✅ MongoDB Atlas connected successfully
🚀 Server running on port XXXX
```

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Cannot find module '@shared/types'"
- **Root Cause**: Railway Root Directory is set to `backend` instead of `/`
- **Fix**: Change Root Directory to `/` in Railway dashboard

### "npm install failed" 
- **Root Cause**: Railway can't find root package.json
- **Fix**: Verify Root Directory is `/` not `backend`

### "SIGTERM" / Container Stopping
- **Root Cause**: MongoDB connection timeout or missing MONGODB_URI
- **Fix**: Add MONGODB_URI environment variable in Railway

## 📊 Expected Railway Build Output

```
==> Building with npm
==> npm install
==> ./start.sh
🚀 Starting Hot Wheels Manager Backend...
📁 Current directory: /app
🏗️  Building application...
> hot-wheels-manager-backend@1.0.0 build
> mkdir -p src/shared && cp -r ../shared/* src/shared/ 2>/dev/null || true && tsc
🚀 Starting server...
✅ MongoDB Atlas connected successfully
🚀 Server running on port 3000
```

## 🎉 Next Steps

1. **Set Root Directory to `/` in Railway**
2. **Add MONGODB_URI environment variable**
3. **Push to trigger deployment**
4. **Monitor logs for successful startup**
5. **Test API endpoints**

**Your Hot Wheels Manager backend is ready for Railway! 🏁**
